# Go RabbitmMQ with Gin

This simple repo shows how:
- to create and start rabbitmq with mongo db
- connect to broker
- consume fanout messages
- push fanout messages


## TODO
[] - products service
[] - add docker docker files to services and add into docker compose config files
[] - add krakend gateway ( to test this thin https://www.krakend.io/docs/backends/amqp-consumer/ )
[] - add simple frontend to iteract
[] - Keycloak?

## Note

Later I will add more services for this toy architecure. To show ( and learn ) how to work with another types of RabbitmMQ connections
