# Go RabbitmMQ with Gin

This simple repo shows how:
- connect to broker
- consume fanout messages
- push fanout messages


## TODO
- [ ] - add simple frontend to iteract

## Note

Later I will add more services for this toy architecure. To show ( and learn ) how to work with another types of RabbitmMQ connections
